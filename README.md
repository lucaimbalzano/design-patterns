# Factory Method
## Creational Design Pattern

### Schema
![Factory Method](img/factory-method-design-pattern.png)

 + Applicability
 
    Use the Factory Method when you don’t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.

    The Factory Method separates product construction code from the code that actually uses the product. Therefore it’s easier to extend the product construction code independently from the rest of the code.
    
    Use the Factory Method when you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components.
